# WP_publication_page

This is code for the publications page of the Ryerson N-CART webiste which is hosted through wordpress. Citations are formatted to IEEE standards.

Working version can be found at [ncart.scs.ryerson.ca/publications](ncart.scs.ryerson.ca/publications)


Note: the versions of the plug-ins I used in the development of this page may have newer versions and those will probably work too

To create a database to be used with the code you must run wpdb_query.sql in your WPDB_Manager to create the database
